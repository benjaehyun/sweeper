    set the initialized state variables ie bomb counter, grid size, number of bombs on board, timer etc 
    show the initialized state 
    only has directions/controls and the 3 difficulty buttons 
    
|difficulty selected| 
    hide the buttons and possibly relocate the directions/controls 
    once a difficulty is selected then run the initizalization (or maybe call it gamestart since its not technically the initialization) 
        declare the empty arrays that will be used as the board/grid 
        use the Math methods for a RNG and randomly assign the preset bomb numbers to the array || note: probably be an array of arrays 
        (probably use a class) to populate a grid with one of the preset grid sizes and number of bombs (static property) based on which difficulty was selected 
        run the function that will determine the placement of the numbers vs empty cells (still need to figure out which need to be filled with a number and which need to be empty)
            also still need to code/decide how your going to store the empty cells in the arrays || probably null bc if u store the value of the array as 0 then u cant also use number data types for the numbers that are displayed in the grid 
        once the grid is populated then begin the render function | question: will you have different render functions for different states/points of the game 
            at least for the initial render: 
                display the overall backdrop, bomb counter, reset/restart button, timer, board/grid, and some message that tells them to 'keep going util they find all of the bombs and clear the remaining squares 
                populate the divs in the grid/board according to the difficulty selected within a parent element that is specified in the html 
                    also remember to use some sort of template literal to assign id's to each new div that will correspond to their array position
                    use some sort of brainching statement OR object nesting to store styling data such as display type, grid arrangement, direction etc for each difficulty
        styling notes: 
            each cell will have various display states: 
                all will have the covered, uncovered, and marked states 
                uncovered states will display the contents or lack thereof 
                    remember that there needs to be some sort of logic or cascade effect that will uncover unoccupied cells that are directly adjacent to each other

|gameplay|
    add the event listeners 
        first event listener: 
            on the reset button and calls the initialization function and will redisplay the difficulty selection and wipe the existing array/state variables. 
                on level select, reinstantiate an object for the new game 
        second event listener: 
            put it on the parent element for whatever the grid is contained in 
    handleClick (figure out how to differentiate left, middle, and right-click)
        if the left click 
            set up a guard to make sure that its on the grid 
            then use the styling of the particular divs, and the div id's (aka the evt.target.id) to access each index in the array 
            always display the cell's contents (think about how u want to do this whether it be an image that is covered or calls a different{hidden} element that will be called based on the cell contents or will there be inner text that will be populated in the div)
            then check if there was a bomb and immediately end the game 
        if middle click 
            reveal all surrounding non-marked squares 
        if right click 
            mark the cell as having a bomb and then reduce the counter for how many bombs are left 
            option: have another marked option that is a yellow flag or something that means that the player is unsure 

|functions| 
    not technically a function, declare a class for populating the array or an array in an object and the related methods 
    code the callback function for the different event listeners and use whatever "method" (not actual method) to accordingly display what u want 
    the middle mouseclick callback function will be different where it performs the left click function for the 9 adjacent squares (if there are 9 surrounding squares, do something else if it is on an edge or in a corner)
    build a running timer that will run asynchronously (and stored for a possible 2nd component to the game)
    

|optional game continuation|
    idea: kind of a combination of a speedrun and memory game where u replay the exact same board and try to remember the bomb positions and re-clear the same board
    store the exact same array of numbers and bomb positions 
    change all of the cells/divs back to their covered state 
    probably have a start button this time just because the completion time matters 
    create a new element on the side 
    probably create a new object that stores the run number and completion time of the most recent run of the grid before appending it to an overall array 
    display the run number and the completion time in that new element 
    keep doing this replay cycle until either: 
        the player completion time is higher than the most recent run 
        player clicks a bomb; player loses a normal game of minesweeper 

|if you somehow finish this in a godly amount of time| 
    develop some sort of system that is shows some sort of hint if the player gets stuck 
        maybe unhide a hint button after a certain amount of time has elapsed since the game start 
    use one of the solving algorithms/logic outlined in "https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/14398552/BECERRA-SENIORTHESIS-2015.pdf" for example 
        i think that this should reveal a logical next move for the player to make based on the previously completed moves 
    the hint can come in any number of forms: 
        maybe highlight a select area (changes based on grid size) that for sure contains a bomb && possibly display the number of bombs in that area depending on the size of the highlighted area 
        highlight the correct next move to make based on the algorithm/logic explained in the above linked thesis 
        maybe find a way to put this into a string and display that string 

|if you somehow turn into jesus christ on a keyboard and finish that too this week| 
    introduce some new scoring system where misclicks are allowed in subsequent runs after the first solve 
    find out a way to get a value that is fairly scored but is still VERY penalizing for clicking on a bomb square 
        maybe look at the way that different typing tests score time against the misspellings but obviously change the weight of errors 
    
|if you cheated on this project and finished everything above| 
    create more levels that will not only increase the bomb and grid size but will also reduce the number of empty cells 
    also for the values that are stored in the cells: make all of the numbers smaller and make larger values less frequent 
        ie, dont have any number that are over 6 or 7 or something and make them few and far 
    note: could affect the logic that populates the cells 
    may not work because i dont know if that logic will exist (but i think it will if i increase the number of bombs appropriately)

|if you cheated AND the feature directly above this one doesn't work| 
    make different modes: 
    first: traditional minesweeper where you choose the grid size that ends after a single solve
    second: game continuation discussed above for a completion time highscore 
    third: 
        make the game progressive 
        start wtih a very easy level and with each solve reinstantiate the board 
        after each completion create a new board that is harder than the last 
        scored by some level classification (such as level number that could then be put into larger categories) and completion time || OR time it took to get to that level in total 

|adtnl features| 
    light and dark mode 


|notes| 
    need to figure out exactly when you want to populate the cells 
        this has an effect on whether or not the player can trigger a bomb on the first click 
    still need to find out how empty spaces are determined 
        MAYBE itll be easier to calculate the value for each cell on the grid before determining the empty cells and then use some sort of logic to make "non-bomb-adjacent squares" that are not adjacent to other "non-bomb-adjacent squares" empty
    still need to do the math for your whichever grid array configuration that u choose and determining those values in reference to random bomb positions 
    implementing a recursive solution ?
